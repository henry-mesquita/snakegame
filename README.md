## About the Project

This project replicates the timeless Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food items, growing longer with each successful meal.

The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with the snakeâ€™s own body or boundaries of the playing field.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Smooth and responsive control of the snake using deques as queues.
- **Food Consumption:** Snake grows in length and score increments upon eating food randomly spawned on the grid.
- **Collision Detection:** Game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
- **User Interface:** Displays score and game-over messages clearly on the game window.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language** Python
- **Game Engine:** Pygame, pygame-gui
- **Built-in Modules:** time, random, typing
